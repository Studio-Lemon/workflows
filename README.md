# Studio Lemon Reusable Workflows

Welcome to Studio Lemon's collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows. This repository contains battle-tested, standardized workflows that help our development teams ship faster and more reliably.

## üéØ Philosophy

**Don't reinvent the wheel every time.**

We believe in creating once, using everywhere. Instead of copy-pasting workflow configurations across multiple repositories and maintaining them separately, we centralize our common deployment and release patterns here. This approach ensures:

- ‚úÖ **Consistency** across all our projects
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability** - fix once, benefit everywhere  
- ‚úÖ **Speed** - new projects get deployment ready in minutes
- ‚úÖ **Reliability** - workflows are battle-tested across multiple projects
- ‚úÖ **Knowledge sharing** - best practices are encoded and documented

## üöÄ Available Workflows

### [Plugin Release](./documentation/plugin-release.md)
**File:** `.github/workflows/plugin-release.yml`

Automates the creation of plugin ZIP archives and GitHub releases.

- Builds plugin with npm/composer dependencies
- Creates clean ZIP archives with dist and blocks folders
- Publishes GitHub releases with assets
- Triggered on Git tags

**Quick Start:**
```yaml
uses: Studio-Lemon/workflows/.github/workflows/plugin-release.yml@main
with:
  plugin_name: 'my-plugin'
secrets: inherit
```

### [SpinupWP Deploy](./documentation/spinup-deploy.md) 
**File:** `.github/workflows/spinup-deploy.yml`

Complete WordPress theme deployment pipeline for SpinupWP servers.

- Auto-detects theme from repository structure
- Builds Composer dependencies with Satispress support  
- Compiles frontend assets with Yarn
- Deploys via rsync to remote servers
- Clears SpinupWP caches

**Quick Start:**
```yaml
uses: Studio-Lemon/workflows/.github/workflows/spinup-deploy.yml@main
secrets: inherit
```

## üìñ How to Use

### 1. Call from Another Repository

Create a workflow file in your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: Studio-Lemon/workflows/.github/workflows/WORKFLOW_NAME.yml@main
    with:
      # workflow-specific inputs
    secrets:
      # required secrets
```

### 2. Organization Benefits

When calling workflows from the same GitHub organization (Studio-Lemon), you can use:

```yaml
secrets: inherit
```

This automatically forwards all secrets from the calling repository to the workflow, simplifying configuration.

### 3. Version Pinning

For production use, consider pinning to specific versions:

```yaml
uses: Studio-Lemon/workflows/.github/workflows/WORKFLOW_NAME.yml@v1.2.3
```

Or use `@main` for the latest version during development.

## üõ† Development

### Adding New Workflows

1. Create the workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
2. Add `workflow_call` trigger with appropriate inputs and secrets
3. Document the workflow in the `documentation/` folder
4. Update this README with the new workflow
5. Test the workflow in a sample repository

### Workflow Design Principles

- **Make inputs optional where possible** - provide sensible defaults
- **Auto-detect configuration** from repository structure when feasible  
- **Centralize common secrets** in this repository to reduce setup burden
- **Fail fast** with clear error messages
- **Document everything** - inputs, outputs, secrets, and usage examples
